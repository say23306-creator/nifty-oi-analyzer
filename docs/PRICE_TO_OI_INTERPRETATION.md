## 📌 1. Overview & Core Philosophy

The **Price to OI Conclusion** system decodes institutional positioning by analyzing the simultaneous directional movement of **Price (LTP)** and **Open Interest (OI)** across hourly snapshots (checkpoints).

- An Option contract represents a levered directional bet.
- **Call Options (CE)**: Move directly with the underlying index (Nifty 50).
- **Put Options (PE)**: Move inversely to the underlying index (Nifty 50). When Nifty falls, Put Option prices rise; when Nifty rises, Put Option prices fall.

By tracking how $(\Delta \text{Price})$ and $(\Delta \text{OI})$ evolve from hour to hour for a specific strike, we identify institutional accumulation (Buildup) vs. institutional distribution/profit booking (Covering/Unwinding).

## ⚖️ 2. Noise Filtering & Deadband Thresholds

Market micro-fluctuations should not trigger false signals. The following strict deadbands apply:

| Metric | Deadband Condition | Classification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price (LTP)** | $|\Delta \text{Price}| \le ₹2.00$ | **NO CHANGE (Neutral / Negligible)** |
| **Open Interest (OI)** | $|\Delta \text{OI}| \le 1,000 \text{ contracts}$ | **NO CHANGE (Neutral / Negligible)** |

### Neutral / Stagnant Condition:
If **Price** changes by $\le \pm 2$ **OR** **OI** changes by $\le \pm 1,000$:
- **Observation:** `NEUTRAL / SIMILAR`
- **Option View:** `NEUTRAL`
- **Stock / Equity (Nifty 50) View:** `NEUTRAL`
- **Conclusion Text:** *"Remained similar to previous hour (Change within ±2 price / ±1,000 OI threshold)"*

### A. CALL OPTIONS (CE) — Direct Correlation with Nifty 50

| Price ($\Delta P > +2$) | OI ($\Delta OI > +1000$) | Observation | Option View | Stock / Equity (Nifty 50) View | Market Action Meaning |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---|
| ⬆️ **UP** | ⬆️ **UP** | **LONG BUILD UP** | 🟢 **BULLISH** | 🟢 **BULLISH** | Aggressive institutional Call buying. Bullish continuation expected. |

## 🚀 5. Implementation Roadmap for Features
1. **Hourly Strike Differential Engine**:
   - Compare Snapshot $H_n$ against Snapshot $H_{n-1}$ for each strike price.
   - Compute `observation`, `option_view`, and `equity_view` dynamically.
2. **Dashboard Visual Indicators**:
   - Visual badges on each strike: `Long Buildup (Bullish)`, `Short Covering (Strong Bullish)`, `Short Buildup (Bearish)`, `Long Covering (Strong Bearish)`, or `Similar`.
   - Aggregate sentiment score: Count how many active ATM/OTM strikes favor Bullish vs. Bearish.
3. **Telegram Real-time Hourly Alert**:
   - Include the overall Price-to-OI conclusion (e.g., *"Top Activity: 23,000 CE showing Short Covering (Strong Bullish), 23,100 PE showing Put Writing (Bullish)"*).
